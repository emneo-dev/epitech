# Epitech

This repo contains all the source code I have produced over the years I have
been at Epitech with every tips and sources that are useful.

## Warning for students

There is a lot of code in there, it doesn't mean you can just copy paste, at
least try to understand it if you look at it, else you'll get flagged for
cheating.

## License

The license can be different for each part of that repository so please look at
each LICENSE file in each folder that you go through. (It is mostly GPL though).

## Timing

I started Epitech during the year 2019/2020, therefore quite a lot of things
have changed and much stuff from here will not be relevant anymore.
A project might be updated to reflect the new changes but don't count on that
too much (The status of a project will always be explicit in its readme).

PS: If something changed about a project open an issue about it and I'll try to
fix it as soon as possible.
