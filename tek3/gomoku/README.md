# Gomoku - Epitech Artificial Intelligence Project

Implementation of a Gomoku game bot in cpp for Piskvork gomoku manager.

# How create my bot

Look at [random_brain.cpp](src/random_brain.cpp), you need to implement some functions like `brainInit`, `brainRestart`, `brainMove` and `brainEnd`.

Derived from [brain_code](include/core/brain_core.hpp), all communications with the manager are done through this class.
You can use it to get infos about the game, to send commands to the manager and to get the response from the manager.
